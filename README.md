# Rufilm-model
Here you find the codes used in the thesis with tittle Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices Based on Ruthenium Complexes Nanomaterials.

The files main.m, fVmesh1D.m, plotMesh.m are used for cyclic voltammetry simulation of multilayered redox films.
reg.m is used to fit cyclic voltammetry data to model i=k1*v+k2*v^(1/2).
