# Rufilm-model
codes used in thesis with tittle Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices Based on Ruthenium Complexes Nanomaterials
main.m, fVmesh1D.m, plotMesh.m are used for cyclic voltammetry simulation of multilayered redox films.
reg.m is used to fit cyclic voltammetry data to model i=k1*v+k2*v^(1/2)
