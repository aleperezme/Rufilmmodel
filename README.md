# Rufilm-model
Here you find the codes used in the thesis with tittle Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices Based on Ruthenium Complexes Nanomaterials.

The files main.m, fVmesh1D.m, plotMesh.m are used for cyclic voltammetry simulation of multilayered redox films. 
main.m is the main program, fVmesh1D.m is a function called by the main program, and plotMesh.m allows to plot the mesh when the option is activated in the fVmesh1D.m program.

reg.m is used to fit cyclic voltammetry data to the model i=k1*v+k2*v^(1/2).
